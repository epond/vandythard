A script to convert flac files to wav and to copy them to removable media, while not copying os x hidden files.

It will process all flac files in the current directory by decoding wav files to a temporary
directory, copying these to the destination and then deleting the temporary directory.

Folder numbers on the Sony PCM-D50 are always two digits ie. 01, 02, ...

```
Usage: vandythard <folder number>
```
