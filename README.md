A script to convert flac files to wav and to copy them to removable media, while not copying os x hidden files.

It will process all flac files in the current directory but decoding wav files to the current
directory, copying these to the destination and then deleting them in the current directory.
Should probably use a temp dir instead.

Usage: vandythard <folder number>
